- Face detection and recognition
- Web-based interface using Streamlit
- CNN-based face encoding and matching
- Support for multiple face recognition

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/khushiiagrawal/face-recognition-cnn-model.git
cd face-recognition-cnn-model
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (3.11 recommended):
```bash
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # For macos

# On Windows, use: 
venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required packages:
